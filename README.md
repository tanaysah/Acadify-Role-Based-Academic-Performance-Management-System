# Acadify-Role-Based-Academic-Performance-Management-System
Acadify is a role-based academic performance management web application for institutions. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL, and Python.
It implements session-based authentication with strict role authorization for Admin, Teacher, and Student users. The database schema is finalized with a centralized users table linked to role-specific tables (admins, teachers, students) and academic entities such as subjects, marks, and doubts. Backend controllers are cleanly structured into Auth, Admin, Teacher, and Student modules, supported by utility classes for session handling, request validation, and standardized responses. The backend logic is fully aligned with the database design, enforces secure access at every endpoint, and is finalized and ready for frontend integration.
